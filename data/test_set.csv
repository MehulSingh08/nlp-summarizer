us to constrain significantly the radii and cooling mechanisms of neutron stars

classes of masers combined with the IRAC and MIPS data to study prominent sites
of ongoing star formation in the nuclear disk. The nuclear disk is
characterized by massive GMCs with elevated gas temperatures, compared to their
dust temperatures. We note an association between methanol masers and a class
of mid-infrared ``green sources''. These highly embedded YSOs show enhanced
4.5micron emission due to excited molecular lines. The distribution of methanol
masers and supernova remnants suggest a low efficiency of star formation (with
the exception of Sgr B2), which we believe is due to an enhanced flux of cosmic
ray electrons impacting molecular clouds in the nuclear disk. We also highlight
the importance of cosmic rays in their ability to heat molecular clouds, and
thus increase the gas temperature.

  and neutrinos","ApJ Letters, in press. Reference to recent MILAGRO results added",,10.1086/521047,,astro-ph,,"  The recent HESS detections of supernova remnant shells in TeV gamma-rays
confirm the theoretical predictions that supernova remnants can operate as
powerful cosmic ray accelerators. If these objects are responsible for the bulk
of galactic cosmic rays, then they should accelerate protons and nuclei to
10^15 eV and beyond, i.e. act as cosmic PeVatrons. The model of diffusive shock
acceleration allows, under certain conditions, acceleration of particles to
such high energies and their gradual injection into the interstellar medium,
mainly during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. The most energetic
particles are released first, while particles of lower energies are more
effectively confined in the shell, and are released at later epochs. Thus the
spectrum of nonthermal paticles inside the shell extends to PeV energies only
during a relatively short period of the evolution of the remnant. For this
reason one may expect spectra of secondary gamma-rays and neutrinos extending
to energies beyond 10 TeV only from T \lesssim 1000 yr old supernova remnants.
On the other hand, if by a chance a massive gas cloud appears in the \lesssim
100 pc vicinity of the supernova remnant, ``delayed'' multi-TeV signals of
gamma-rays and neutrinos arise when the most energetic partices emerged from
the supernova shell reach the cloud. The detection of such delayed emission of
multi-TeV gamma-rays and neutrinos allows indirect identification of the
supernova remnant as a particle PeVatron.

results. However, as we show, the extremely low velocity dispersions of the
axions velocity are required to form the single vortex on the galactic scales.
We find that the required velocity dispersion is of the order of $\sigma
\approx 10^{-12} \frac{m}{s}$. This is much smaller that predicted within the
present understanding of the axion physics. The vortices in axion condensate
can be however formed on the much smaller scales and give seeds to the galaxy
formation and to their angular momenta. On the other hand, the vortices can be
formed on the galactic scales, but only if the mass of the axion-like particles

Survey in the redshift interval 0.5<z<1.3. We used the amplitude of the 4000
Balmer break (Dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the EW[OII]3727
line as proxy for the star formation activity. We discuss to what extent
stellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplay
between stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8Gyr. Low-mass galaxies
have small Dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution moves
to higher Dn4000 values as observed in the local Universe. As cosmic time goes
by, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically ET systems
at the expense of the LT systems. This spectral transformation is a process
started at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe.
This is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.
The underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution,
likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation
activity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked
in the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation
taking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming
stars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes
progressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. The concepts
of star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a single
scenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. The role of (dry) merging
events seems to be only marginal at z<1.3, as our estimated efficiency in
stellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation of
passively evolving galaxies.

listen to the channel and, if sensed idle, will transmit during the voids. It
turns out that, although its simplicity, the proposed scheme showed very
interesting features with respect to the spectral efficiency and the maximum
number of possible pairwise cognitive communications. We impose the constraint
that users successively transmit over available bands through selfish water
filling. For the first time, our study has quantified the asymptotic (with
respect to the band) achievable gain of using spectrum pooling in terms of
spectral efficiency compared to classical radio systems. We then derive the

theoretical predictions for $\la Z\ra$ as a function of $f$ are in excellent
agreement with simulations for N=100 and 1600. However, even with N=1600, the

A strongly hydrophobic polymer remains globular as long as $f$ is less than a

in hydrogen up to large n. For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting
formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.
Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and
accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves
a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term
naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the
vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical
corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the
Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up
to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss
the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the
two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of
cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of
photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on
the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our
computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the
additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the
percent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4%
at redshift z~1160. This is numerically similar to the result of another recent
study; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different. In
particular, our calculations of the effective two-photon decay rates yield
significantly different values, where the destructive interference of the

describe a theoretical model for the expected radial distribution of extrasolar

calibrated disk model. The disk model includes viscous evolution and mass loss
via photoevaporation. Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly
selected subsample of planets from the Lick / Keck / AAT planet search
programs, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk
at a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription,
and become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the
radial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet
masses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by
existing data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample
of planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model
predicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of
orbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet
population. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon
the adopted disk model. We find that the distribution can constrain not only
changes in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, but also sharp jumps in

Several observables are examined, including the W helicity fractions and new
quantities recently introduced, such as the ratios of helicity fractions and
some angular asymmetries defined in the W rest frame. The dependence on
anomalous couplings of all these observables has been previously obtained. In
this work we show that some of the new observables also have smaller systematic
uncertainties than the helicity fractions, with a dependence on anomalous
couplings similar or stronger than for helicity fractions. Consequently, their
measurement can significantly improve the limits on anomalous couplings.
Moreover, the most sensitive measurements can be combined. In this case, the
precision achieved in the determination of Wtb anomalous couplings can be of a
few percent in the semileptonic channel alone.

systems provides a powerful test that can potentially discriminate amongst
cosmological models. However, applications of this elegant test have been
curtailed by two factors: our ignorance of how galaxies evolve with redshift,
and the absence of methods to deal with the effect of incomplete information in
lensing systems. In this paper, we investigate both issues in detail. We
explore how to extract the properties of evolving galaxies, assuming that the
cosmology is well determined by other techniques. We propose a new nested Monte
Carlo method to quantify the effects of incomplete data. We apply the
lens-redshift test to an improved sample of seventy lens systems derived from
recent observations, primarily from the SDSS, SLACS and the CLASS surveys. We
find that the limiting factor in applying the lens-redshift test derives from
poor statistics, including incomplete information samples, and biased sampling.
Many lenses that uniformly sample the underlying true image separation
distribution will be needed to use this test as a complementary method to
measure the value of the cosmological constant or the properties of evolving
galaxies. Planned future surveys by missions like the SNAP satellite or LSST
are likely to usher in a new era for strong lensing studies that utilize this
test. With expected catalogues of thousands of new strong lenses, the
lens-redshift test could offer a powerful tool to probe cosmology as well as
galaxy evolution.

time at z = 20 to a final mass-weighted mean shock radius of 2.5 kpc (proper),
roughly half the size of the HII region, and in this process sweeps up a total
gas mass of 2.5*10^5 M_sun. The morphology of the shock becomes highly
anisotropic once it leaves the host halo and encounters filaments and
neighboring minihalos, while the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids of
the intergalactic medium. The SN entirely disrupts the host halo and terminates
further star formation for at least 200 Myr, while in our specific case it
exerts positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos by
shock-compressing their cores. In contrast, we do not observe secondary star
formation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation, due to the
previous photoheating by the progenitor star. We find that cooling by metal
lines is unimportant for the entire evolution of the SN remnant, while the
metal-enriched, interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities created
by the shock, and ultimately into the voids with a maximum extent similar to
the final mass-weighted mean shock radius. Finally, we conclude that dark
matter halos of at least M_vir > 10^8 M_sun must be assembled to recollect all

equatorial disk through a rotating surface explosion. Material is launched
normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity
that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta
follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force
corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually
similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we
modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a
rotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently.
Continuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in
line-driven winds. Our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot
stars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass
ejections, without an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although
motivated by eta Carinae, the model may have generic application to other LBVs,
B[e] stars, or SN1987A's nebula. When near-Eddington radiative driving is less
influential, our model generalizes to produce bipolar morphologies without
disks, as seen in many PNe.

the periphery of Carina provides a strong case that star formation here was
indeed triggered by stellar winds and UV radiation. This second generation
appears to involve a cascade toward preferentially intermediate- and low-mass
stars, but this may soon change when eta Car and its siblings explode. If the
current reservoir of atomic and molecular gas can be tapped at that time,
massive star formation may be rejuvinated around the periphery of Carina much
as if it were a young version of Gould's Belt. Also, when these multiple SNe

our sample quasars, excluding radio-loud and broad absorption line (BAL)
objects, we find a mean X-ray power-law photon index of
Gamma=1.92^{+0.09}_{-0.08} and constrain any neutral intrinsic absorbing
material to have a mean column density of N_H<~2x10^{21} cm^{-2}. We find,
consistent with other studies, that Gamma does not change with redshift, and we
constrain the amount of allowed Gamma evolution for the most-luminous quasars.
Our sample, excluding radio-loud and BAL quasars, has a mean X-ray-to-optical
spectral slope of a_ox=-1.80+/-0.02, as well as no significant evolution of
a_ox with redshift. We also comment upon the X-ray properties of a number of
notable quasars, including an X-ray weak quasar with several strong narrow
absorption-line systems, a mildly radio-loud BAL quasar, and a well-studied
gravitationally lensed quasar.

stellar multiplicity inhibits or promotes planet formation. There is a
degeneracy between planet formation models when only systems with single stars
are studied--several mechanisms appear to be able to produce such a final
result. This degeneracy is lifted by searching for planets in binary systems;
the resulting detections (or evidence of non-existence) of planets in binaries
isolates which models may contribute to how planets form in nature. In this
chapter, we consider observational efforts to detect planetary companions to
binary stars in two types of hierarchical planet-binary configurations: first
``S-type'' planets which orbit just one of the stars, with the binary period
being much longer than the planet's; second, ``P-type'' or circumbinary
planets, where the planet simultaneously orbits both stars, and the planetary
orbital period is much longer than that of the binary. The S-type planet
finding techniques are different for binaries that can or cannot be spatially
resolved. For wider systems, techniques reviewed include dualstar
interferometric differential astrometry and precision radial velocities.
Alternatively, unresolved binaries can be studied using modified dualstar
""PHASES-style"" differential astrometry or a modification of the radial velocity
technique for composite spectra. Should a fortunately aligned--but still long

planets. Methods for detecting P-type planets include the composite-spectra

the determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor
pixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement
for a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is
validated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic
units. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire
surface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be
estimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is
estimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread
function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian
approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the
single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian
approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)
narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of
columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled
two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape
uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors.
The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values
54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled
modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the
existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and
the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the

studied within the framework of QCD factorization. The main results are: (i)
The decay rates for the $f_0(980)K^{*-}$ and $f_0(980)\ov K^{*0}$ modes depend
on the $f_0-\sigma$ mixing angle $\theta$. The experimental measurements can be
accommodated for $\theta\approx 20^\circ$. (ii) If the $a_0(980)$ is a $q\bar
q$ bound state, the predicted branching ratios for the channels $a_0^+\rho^-$
and $a_0^0\rho^-$ will be very large, of order $30\times 10^{-6}$ and $23\times
10^{-6}$, respectively. If the observation of or the experimental limit on
theses two modes is much smaller than the expectation of $\sim 25\times
10^{-6}$, this could hint at a four-quark nature for the $a_0(980)$. (iii) For
the $a_0(1450)$ channels, $a_0^+(1450)\rho^-$ and $a_0^0(1450)\rho^-$ are found
to have branching ratios of order $16\times 10^{-6}$ and $22\times 10^{-6}$,
respectively. A measurement of them at the predicted level will favor the
$q\bar q$ structure for the $a_0(1450)$. (iv) Contrary to the naive expectation
that $\Gamma(B^-\to a_0^0\rho^-)\sim {1\over 2}\Gamma(\bar B^0\to
a_0^+\rho^-)$, we found that they have comparable rates due to additional
contributions to the $a_0\rho^-$ mode from the $a_0^0$ emission. (v) The
predicted central value of $Br(\bar B^0\to\ov K^{*0}_0(1430)\phi)$ is larger
than experiment, though it can be accommodated within theoretical errors. The
decays $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\rho$ are expected to have rates substantially larger
than that of $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\pi$ owing to the constructive (destructive)
interference between the $a_4$ and $a_6$ penguin terms in the former (latter).
Experimentally, it is thus important to check if the $B\to K^{*}_0\rho$ modes
are enhanced relative to the corresponding $K_0^*\pi$ channels.

a statistically isotropic scalar signal from noise-contaminated data on a
region of the unit sphere. Three different methods of spectral estimation are
considered: (i) the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D)
periodogram, (ii) the maximum likelihood method, and (iii) a spherical analogue
of the 1-D multitaper method. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage,
especially for small regions of area $A\ll 4\pi$, and is generally unsuitable
for spherical spectral analysis applications, just as it is in 1-D. The maximum
likelihood method is particularly useful in the case of nearly-whole-sphere
coverage, $A\approx 4\pi$, and has been widely used in cosmology to estimate
the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation from spacecraft
observations. The spherical multitaper method affords easy control over the
fundamental trade-off between spectral resolution and variance, and is easily
implemented regardless of the region size, requiring neither non-linear
iteration nor large-scale matrix inversion. As a result, the method is ideally
suited for most applications in geophysics, geodesy or planetary science, where
the objective is to obtain a spatially localized estimate of the spectrum of a
signal from noisy data within a pre-selected and typically small region.
